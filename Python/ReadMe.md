# Python Focus Areas

## Direction - How to approach
- Please ensure to cover [Python Programming aspects early in your learning journey](https://github.com/kkm24132/Mentoring_Enablement/tree/master/Python/Basics)
- Please pick one of these [Books to follow basics and fundamentals](https://github.com/kkm24132/Mentoring_Enablement/tree/master/Python#python-books)
- More Python Basics [from Google Learning - Grow with Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
- ML Explainability using LIME [ML Explainability using LIME](https://github.com/kkm24132/Mentoring_Enablement/tree/master/Python/Basics/MLExplainability_using_LIME.ipynb)
- Here are some [PyTorch related examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/) (Focus around examples in pytorch in vision, text, reinforcement learning etc.)
- Deep Learning with PyTorch: check for "A 60 minute Blitz" - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
