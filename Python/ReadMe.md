# Python Focus Areas

## Direction - How to approach
- Please ensure to cover [Python Programming aspects early in your learning journey](https://github.com/kkm24132/Mentoring_Enablement/tree/master/Python/Basics)
- More Python Basics [from Google Learning - Grow with Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
- ML Explainability using LIME ![ML Explainability using LIME](https://github.com/kkm24132/Mentoring_Enablement/tree/master/Python/Basics/MLExplainability_using_LIME.ipynb)
- Here are some [PyTorch related examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/) (Focus around examples in pytorch in vision, text, reinforcement learning etc.)
- Deep Learning with PyTorch: check for "A 60 minute Blitz" - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
