## Industry: Aerospace/Aviation and Defense

### Focus: AI/ML use cases around this industry

#### Use Cases

- Surveillance
  - AI combined with geospatial analysis can aid in the extraction of useful information from linked devices like radars and autonomous identification systems. This data can aid in the detection of any unlawful or suspicious activity, as well as alerting the appropriate authorities. 
  - Target recognition and classification can also be aided by AI-enabled robots and IoT-enabled computer vision.
- Ammunition and Arms
  - Predictive Maintenance to detect failure of equipment in future
  - AI-enabled technology is now incorporated in new-age weaponry. Advanced missiles, for example, can estimate and examine the target level for kill zones without the need for human participation.
- Logistics
  - Logistics is one of the most critical variables in determining whether or not a military mission succeeds. ML and geospatial analysis are integrated with military logistic systems to decrease effort, time, and error.
- Cybersecurity
- Dynamic Pricing
- Pricing Optimization
- Flight Delay Prediction
- Flight Route Optimization
- Avoiding Travel Disruption
- Crew Scheduling
- Fraud Detection
- Customer Service and Retention
