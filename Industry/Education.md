There are different ways Data Science and AI can help drive benefits in the Education industry. The core is to see how to help educators as they navigate the evolving digital landscape. The core will be students, teachers/professors, and support staff to drive outcomes.

The approach can certainly be a safety-first one to ensure that we are minimizing the risks, and maximizing safety and security for our students and our teachers/professors, but also a cautiously ambitious approach to make sure that the ecosystem can get the most value out of the opportunities created by artificial intelligence in education.

It is clear that while the transformative potential of AI is yet to fully emerge, AI is here to stay, and its evolving use will undoubtedly become more prevalent in schools and workplaces. Education systems will need to be holistic and balance academic with non-academic factors
to reflect a broadening understanding of student success and establish children’s place as global citizens in a rapidly changing world. During the process, not only Generative AI be a value-add, but the code of traditional ML techniques will add significant value in solving problems when the rubber hits the road.
