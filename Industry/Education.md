## Industry: Education

There are different ways Data Science and AI can help drive benefits in the Education industry. The core is to see how to help educators as they navigate the evolving digital landscape. The core will be students, teachers/professors, and support staff to drive outcomes.

The approach can certainly be a safety-first one to ensure that we are minimizing the risks, and maximizing safety and security for our students and our teachers/professors, but also a cautiously ambitious approach to make sure that the ecosystem can get the most value out of the opportunities created by artificial intelligence in education.

It is clear that while the transformative potential of AI is yet to fully emerge, AI is here to stay, and its evolving use will undoubtedly become more prevalent in schools and workplaces. Education systems will need to be holistic and balance academic with non-academic factors
to reflect a broadening understanding of student success and establish children’s place as global citizens in a rapidly changing world. During the process, not only Generative AI be a value-add, but the code of traditional ML techniques will add significant value in solving problems when the rubber hits the road.

The opportunities around use cases are immense. Some of them are listed below to give a flavor.

- 1) Personalized Learning for STUDENTS
  - AI tutoring systems have been around for several years. Their progress and utility are likely to be bolstered by advancements
in generative AI through dialogue-based tutoring, which can receive a written or spoken response which is then evaluated with feedback. Providing appropriate controls are in place, generative AI can play a role in permitting educators to build more personalized learning plans for students, allowing students to receive more adaptive and frequent feedback. This could be powerful for students who struggle with traditional learning or have particular learning needs.
- 2) Student Assessment Data Analysis for TEACHERS/PROFESSORS
- 3) Social and Behavioural Skills
  - How teachers can detect whether students can use their social skills during the classes or not
  - Helping students enhance their personality development
  - Also, they will be able to pay extra attention to students who need ‘help’ and conduct sessions with counselors or therapists 
- 4) Parents / Carers interaction effectiveness
- 5) Keep up to date with the curriculum for TEACHERS/PROFESSORS
- Instructor performance
- Student's demographics
