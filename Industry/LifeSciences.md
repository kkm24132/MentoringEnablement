## Life Sciences in AI

- Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine/vaccine related problem

It is important to understand different business processes - around payers, prescribers, insurers etc. Then which use case themes are relevant from AI/ML perspective are also very important. 

When we look at this domain, following could be potential broad areas where AI/ML plays significant role and create impact:
- **Patient Care**
  - Patient data analysis and visualization
  - Personalized medications and care
  - Realtime or near real time case prioritization and triage
  - Assisted / Automated diagnosis and prescription
  - Any specific disease care management (e.g. Oncology treatment, Epidemiology, Pregnancy Management) from end to end to give a 360 degree to patient care
  - Assist in preventive care for patients
- **Medical Imaging and Diagnostics**
  - Diagnostic error prevention
  - Medical imaging insights
  - Early diagnostics
  - Imaging analysis for critical care area with prioritization
- **Reasearch and Development**
  - Drug Discovery
  - Gene analytics and editing
  - Device and drug comparative effectiveness
- **Predictive Maintenance**
  - Device and component level failure prediction (Devices such as Xray machines, ECG machines etc.) - mostly large medical equipment manufacturing firms. Benefits: Availability of devices going up to some percent points, Predicting failures upto X%
- **Management and Operations**
  - Pricing analytics
  - Risk analytics
  - Brand management and marketing
  - Market Research
