## Manufacturing Industry Use Cases / Problems where Data and AI play role

**1) Objective - is to capture use cases around Manufacturing and Supply chain specific industry segment where Data Science and AI play significant amount of role and impact.**

Use Case areas:
- Predictive Maintenance
- Yield Optimization
- Procurement and Spend Analytics
- Inventory and Parts Optimization
- Logistics network and Warehouse Optimization
- Sales and Demand Forecast

Of course above are not exhaustive and gives a very high level indication of key use case themes.

**2) Impact of AI by Functions:** As per McKinsey analysis, it seems AI's potential impact is greatest in few functions where Manufacturing and Supply chain management functions are also dominant. If we refer to below information, we will get some idea related to this.

**3) Use Case Themes:** Typical use case themes are anyways highlighted above. As per Mickinsey analysis, the following represents some of these use case areas within Manufacturing and Supply chain management functions for business.
- Predictive Maintenance and Yield Optimization seems to take a larger pie of the cake and hence there are lot of opportunities around that

**4) AI Techniques Relevance to Functions:** If we refer to heat map of various Data Science techniques and their relevance to solving business use cases across functions, then we can get some interesting statistics. If we focus on Manufacturing and Supply Chain, we can understand the following:
- Lot of focus building around Feed Forward Networks, Reinforcement Learning and CNN (Convolutional Neural Nets) etc.
- The traditional analytics techniques are focusing around Tree based ensemble learning (Random forest etc.), Regression Analysis and Statistical Inferences etc.
- Predictive Analytics are playing critical role and hence techniques around these will help solve key problems
- Lot of Optimization problems exists and hence optimization techniques will also be useful in solving such use cases

## Mining Industry Use Cases / Problems where Data and AI play role

- Remote exploitation of mines and error elimination through data analysis
  - AI can help user to better understand the environment and the terrain where exploitation is to begin. The exposure of frontline mineworkers to dangerous situations is going to be reduced.
  - Derived data can also be used for reclamation programs, where re-establishment of the natural environment of the area is required
- Autonomous mining vehicles inside the mine that can be remotely operated and managed
- How can autonomous personnel tracking sharpen safety during the mining process - using sensors data analysis
- Autonomous mining to remotely identify copper grades with the lowest possible error rate
- Neural networks for efficient beneficiation
  - Smart sorting is already applied in the mining industry for minerals and ores, and AI algorithms powered by color sensors and X-ray data are improving the quality and quantity of, for example, the diamond recovery process.

These are few use cases for example mentioned above. Lots of such use cases can be thought of.
