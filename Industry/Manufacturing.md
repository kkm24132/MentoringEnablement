## Manufacturing Industry Use Cases / Problems where Data and AI play role

**Objective - is to capture use cases around Manufacturing and Supply chain specific industry segment where Data Science and AI play significant amount of role and impact.**

Use Case areas:
- Predictive Maintenance
- Yield Optimization
- Procurement and Spend Analytics
- Inventory and Parts Optimization
- Logistics network and Warehouse Optimization
- Sales and Demand Forecast

Of course above are not exhaustive and gives a very high level indication of key use case themes.

**Impact of AI by Functions:** As per McKinsey analysis, it seems AI's potential impact is greatest in few functions where Manufacturing and Supply chain management functions are also dominant. If we refer to below information, we will get some idea related to this.

**AI Techniques Relevance to Functions:** If we refer to heat map of various Data Science techniques and their relevance to solving business use cases across functions, then we can get some interesting statistics. If we focus on Manufacturing and Supply Chain, we can understand the following:
- Lot of focus building around Feed Forward Networks, Reinforcement Learning and CNN (Convolutional Neural Nets) etc.
- The traditional analytics techniques are focusing around Tree based ensemble learning (Random forest etc.), Regression Analysis and Statistical Inferences etc.
- Predictive Analytics are playing critical role and hence techniques around these will help solve key problems
- Lot of Optimization problems exists and hence optimization techniques will also be useful in solving such use cases
