## AI in Supply Chain

### Typical Use Cases

Data Science and AI has several applications in the supply chain function. Some key use cases are as follows:

- Demand Forecasting: AI algorithms can analyze historical sales data, market trends, and external factors to generate more accurate demand forecasts. This helps organizations optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction.

- Inventory Optimization: AI can optimize inventory levels by analyzing factors such as lead times, customer demand patterns, and supplier performance. By dynamically adjusting reorder points, safety stock levels, and replenishment schedules, AI helps minimize carrying costs while ensuring adequate stock availability.

- Route Optimization: AI algorithms can analyze real-time data, such as traffic conditions, weather forecasts, and delivery constraints, to optimize transportation routes. This reduces fuel consumption, transportation costs, and delivery times while improving overall logistics efficiency.

- Supplier Selection and Risk Assessment: AI can assess and analyze large amounts of supplier data, including financial performance, quality metrics, and compliance records, to support supplier selection decisions. AI can also monitor supplier performance in real time and identify potential risks or disruptions in the supply chain.

- Warehouse Automation: AI-powered robotics and automation systems can optimize warehouse operations, including inventory picking, sorting, and packing. These systems can work collaboratively with human workers to enhance productivity, reduce errors, and accelerate order fulfillment.

- Predictive Maintenance: AI algorithms can analyze sensor data from equipment and machinery to predict maintenance needs accurately. By identifying potential failures or performance degradation in advance, organizations can schedule maintenance activities proactively, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance costs.

- Risk Management and Resilience: AI can help identify and mitigate supply chain risks by continuously monitoring and analyzing a wide range of data sources, including social media, news feeds, and weather reports. AI can alert organizations to potential disruptions, such as natural disasters, geopolitical events, or supplier issues, enabling them to take timely action and ensure business continuity.

- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle customer inquiries, track shipments, and provide real-time updates. These conversational AI systems enhance customer service, reduce response times, and improve overall customer experience.

- Quality Control: AI can automate quality control processes by analyzing product data and identifying defects or anomalies. Visual inspection systems powered by AI can detect product defects with high accuracy, ensuring that only quality products are released to customers.

### Operational Challenges

- Data quality and availability
  - Need for data curation
  - Need for business relevant data 
- Data integration and compatibility
  - Typically need for integration across ERP, Transportation management systems, Warehouse management systems make it complex for integration and harmonization
  - data with different formats
  - Ensuring seamless data flow across systems from source to target is critical 
- Change management and organisational alignment
- Talent and skill gap
  - domain + tech skills are rare to find
  - finding and retaining talent 
  - balance between upskilling existing employees and hiring new talents (build vs buy to decide as well)
- Model explainability and transparency
- Scalability and adaptability
- Ethical considerations
