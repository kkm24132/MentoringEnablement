## Public Sector and Govt service related Industry Use Cases / Problems where Data and AI play role

**1) Objective - is to capture use cases around specific industry segment where Data Science and AI play significant amount of role and impact.**

Use Case areas:
- Defense and Intelligence
- Public Safety and Policing
- National Infrastructure
- Education
- Social Services
- Tax and Revenue Management

Of course above are not exhaustive and gives a very high level indication of key use case themes.

**2) Key Factors of Impact

AI can help government agencies and authorities solve various complex problems that they face. Key factors which are of impact are as follows:

- Accuracy : When it comes to Machine Learning models / algorithms, public-sector users can measure performance in terms of effective and better decision making. Examples of use cases could be the following:
  - Determine where to focus tax audits
  - Determine which students get scholarships / funding based on probability to graduate
  - Prioritize investments in road work by analyzing traffic bottlenecks
- Explainability : Critical in today's world to understand root cause of decisions made by ML models, how and which features are influencing the target most etc.
- Fairness
  - Willful blindness
  - Demographic parity
  - Predictive equality
- Stability
  - Stability is particularly important in the public sector, where many external factors affect decision making. Consider the example of fraud-mitigation models and public benefits. Fraud patterns evolve very quickly. In addition, changes to benefit requirements can meaningfully affect the kind of fraud that governments experience and the data that the machine-learning model was trained on. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, many US states experienced a substantial spike in identity fraud related to unemployment benefit claims. A data set created prior to COVID-19 would not have seen this trend. Such changes can create shocks to the system that render historical data less capable of predicting the futureâ€”and thereby invalidate traditional heuristics or decision-making rules.
  - To estimate the frequency at which models should be refreshed, users must understand the speed at which algorithmic performance degrades. One way to do this is to test its performance using backward-looking data over different time spans. If the model performs great on test data that lapsed a year ago but not on data that lapsed two years ago, then retraining the model somewhere between a year and two years will likely help avoid degradation.
- Adoption : A novel / innovative Machine Learning model may not be the greatest by itself. It needs to be wrapped in an intuitive user-centric experience and better applicability into workflows
