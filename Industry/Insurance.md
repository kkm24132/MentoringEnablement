## Typical Use Cases in Insurance

Use Case Area    | UC Description  |
-----------------|-----------------|
Policy Lapsation |Policy lapsation is the biggest pain area for life insurers. Almost 50 % of policies lapse in India before they complete 5 years. With the help of this model, customers can be contacted in advance who have high chances of lapsing their policies. Controlling lapsation will lead to higher premium income for the insurer, increasing commission income for the sales force, customer satisfaction and also a valuable risk cover for the customers.|
Customer attrition |This data science model predicts the attrition of customers. Attrition could be in the form of surrender or lapsation of policies. An early surrender leads to loss of premium income for the insurer and also loss of risk cover for the customer. Surrendering a policy early involves lots of deduction of charges. The customer never gets back what he paid for. The model looks for the pattern in the data. The insurer also comes to know which of its products are not popular and can redesign the products as per customerâ€™s requirement.|
Product Affinity |Product affinity studies behaviors of the customers so that they can be cross sold with new products. This data science model helps in targeting the customer with an alternative plan. For example a customer having a Ulip policy could be targeted for a traditional plan. A customer after age 40 can be targeted for a pension plan. The insurer can study the data of the customers visiting its web site. Some of them could be existing customers and some of them would be new customers. Looking at the pattern of the data, customers can be targeted with alternative products. You might have seen same thing when you go to Amazon site. In the bottom of the screen it recommends the products which you can buy basing upon your buying behavior.|
Agent's attrition |Life insurance agents do most of the business for life insurers. They are also called Fee on Street. Insurers spend considerable amount of money and time to train and hire insurance agents. If these agents leave in between then the cost incurred is never recovered. LIC of India has more than One million agents as a part of its sales force. This data science model predicts the attrition of an agent basing upon Annualized premium of polices sold by him, no of policies sold by him every year, lapse policies, duration with the company etc. With the attrition of agent, chances are high that policies sold by that agent would lapse in future. By looking at the behavior of agents, insurers can take suitable measures to retain them.|
Renewal premium forecasting |This data science model forecasts the renewal premium to be collected on existing policies on the books of life insurers. This helps in setting the targets for the sales team and helps in maintaining persistency of the policies.|
Customer Life Time Value |This data science model helps in determining life time value of a customer. The model determines the value of current policies owned by the customer and expected tenure of current policies. It also takes into consideration the new policies customer can buy and forecasting of premium earned on these policies. The lapsation model, repurchase model and forecasting model are also taken into consideration. The model also takes into consideration fixed cost associated with each policy. The model can later be used in cross sell, up sell and targeting the customers across different marketing campaigns.|
Agent Life Time Value |This data science model helps in calculating the life time value of an insurance agent basing upon business done by him so far and expected business he can generate for the company in future. Most of the policies in insurance companies are sold by an insurance agent. He is the link between the insurer and the customer. This model takes into consideration number of policies sold by the agent, first year premium income earned, likely renewal premium to be earned on the policies, commission to be paid and fixed cost involved for retaining the agent. Once the ALTV is determined, insurance companies can take extras measures to retain top performers by giving them extra incentives.|
Orphan Customer identification Model |An insurance agent is an important link between the customer and insurance company. If agent leaves the insurance company, there is no one to serve the customers of that agent which leads to lapsation of policies sold by that agent and in turn leads to loss of revenue for the company. This model helps in identification of orphan customers.|
